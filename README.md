# Course Project - 3A
### This's __Server-side__ part of the university course project "***Matrix Math***"

Responds on requests, process above them. Implements basic _matrix_ operations and algorithms.

#### Algorithms to implement:
- [x] Matrix addition
- [x] Matrix subtitution
- [x] Matrix multiplication by a number
- [x] Matrix multiplication
- [x] Transpose the matrix
- [x] Calculate the matrix **determinant** using Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting
- [ ] Matrix rank
- [x] Invert a matrix
- [ ] Find inverse matrix
- [x] Solves a system of linear equations: ```Ax = b```
- [x] Solves a system of linear equations: ```Ax = b```, using an iterative error **correction algorithm**

```Solution, to find the inverse matrix: swap the positions of a and d, put negatives in front of b and c, and divide everything by the determinant (ad-bc).```
